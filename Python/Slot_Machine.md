Explanation of Changes

    Class-based Design: Encapsulated the game logic within a SlotMachine class.
    Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each method has a single responsibility.
    Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The class can be extended with new functionalities (e.g., adding more symbols) without modifying existing code.
    Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Not applicable as we don't have inheritance here.
    Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Not applicable as we don't have interfaces here.
    Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Not directly applicable, but using dependency injection for the initial balance and symbols can be considered.
